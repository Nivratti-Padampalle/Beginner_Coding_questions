You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,9,7], k = 5

Output: 4

Explanation:

Perform 4 operations on nums[1] = 9. Now, nums = [3, 5, 7].
The sum is 15, which is divisible by 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,3], k = 4

Output: 0

Explanation:

The sum is 8, which is already divisible by 4. Hence, no operations are needed.

    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
      int op = 0,rem = 0;
      int sum = 0;
      for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        sum = sum + nums[i];
      }
      if(sum % k == 0){
        return op;
      }
      else if(sum % k != 0){
         rem = sum % k;
      }
      return rem;
